I started my journey with WordPress not long ago when I was trying to fix a now defunct blog of mine. The world of web development and its possibilities opened  up and  I became super curious about it.

This  year I have been exploring HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm also familiar with Bootstrap and Bulma.  if you Have a junior role coming up shoot me an email. I'm currently looking for any opportunity that would suit my background.
